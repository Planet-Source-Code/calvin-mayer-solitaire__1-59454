### Description

Solitaire! This is a remake of the solitaire game that comes with Windows. I'm pretty sure there aren't any bugs, at least none that I've come across. Updated: added options, scoring, time and the ability to choose your deck back! The only difference between mine and Microsoft's now is undo.
 
### More Info
 
Caution: using this program will make the monkey that lives in your monitor get very angry and cause him to try and smash your brains in. You have been warned!
